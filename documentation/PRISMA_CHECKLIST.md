## Deviations from Standard PRISMA

### Protocol Registration
**Deviation**: Review not registered in PROSPERO or similar registry
**Justification**: Academic thesis-based review; registration not required by institution

### Meta-Analysis
**Deviation**: Narrative synthesis instead of quantitative meta-analysis
**Justification**: High heterogeneity in models, datasets, and evaluation metrics precluded formal meta-analysis

### Both acceptable under PRISMA 2020 guidelines for exploratory systematic reviews

## Data Availability

### Public Repository
All data, code, and materials are publicly available:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/samuelseidel/llm-financial-sentiment-analysis-dataset
